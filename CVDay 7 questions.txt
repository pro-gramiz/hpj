Question 2:
Problem Description
The task is to count all the possible paths from top left to bottom right of a m x n matrix with the constraints that from each cell you can either move only to right or down.
Input: 
•	First line consists of T test cases. First line of every test case consists of N and M, denoting the number of rows and number of columns respectively.
Output: 
•	Single line output i.e count of all the possible paths from top left to bottom right of a m x n matrix..
Constraints:
•	1<=T<=100
•	1<=N<=100
•	1<=M<=100
Test Case 1:
	Input: 3 3
	Output: 6
Test Case 2:
	Input: 4 3
