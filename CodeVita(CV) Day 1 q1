Consecutive Prime Sum:

from math import sqrt
n=int(input())
l=[]
for i in range(2,n):
    s=int(sqrt(i))
    for j in range(2,s+1):
        if(i%j==0):
            break
    else:
        l.append(i)
cnt=0
print(l)
for k in range(1,len(l)):
    sum=0
    for m in l:
        sum+=m
        if sum==l[k]:
     cnt+=1
        elif sum>l[k]:
            break
print(cnt)
        

Explanation:   In first for loop I have found prime numbers for the given input range and append it to a list. In second loop I have taken range from 1 to length of list because only one digit cannot have consecutive prime sum. Then in another loop I am adding all the elements in the list one by one and checking whether the sum is  consecutive sum or not and incrementing the sum if it was consecutive prime sum.
