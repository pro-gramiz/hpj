Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.
For example, the square matrix arr is shown below:
1 2 3
4 5 6
9 8 9  

The left-to-right diagonal = 1+5+9=15. The right to left diagonal =3+5+9=17 . Their absolute difference is |15-17|=2

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer ,n , the number of rows and columns in the matrix arr.
Each of the next n lines describes a row,arr[i] , and consists of  space-separated integers arr[i][j].
 
Constraints
-100<=arr[i][j]<=100

Output Format
Print the absolute difference between the sums of the matrix's two diagonals as a single integer.
Sample Input
3
11    2     4
4      5     6
10    8    -12
Sample Output

15
 
Explanation
The primary diagonal is:
11
   5
     -12
Sum across the primary diagonal: 11 + 5 - 12 = 4
The secondary diagonal is:
     4
   5
10
Sum across the secondary diagonal: 4 + 5 + 10 = 19

Difference: |4 - 19| = 15
Note: |x| is the absolute value of x




source code:
a =int(input())
b=[]
for i in range(a):
    l=list(map(int,input().split(' ')))
    b.append(l)
d1 = 0
d2 = 0
for i in range(0, a): 
    for j in range(0, a):
        if(i==j): 
            d1+=b[i][j] 
        if(i==a-j-1): 
            d2+=b[i][j] 
print(abs(d1-d2))
